# LegoImageClassifier
Image to classify Lego pieces into 16 different categories using VGG16  
Train.csv contains data on which image belongs to which class.
NOTE: While executing code on Google Colab , the Ordering of classes changes from 1,2,3...16 to 1,10,11...16,2,3,...9. Hence predicted value =3 implies class number 11 instead of class number 3.
Cheers!
